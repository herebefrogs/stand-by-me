Stand by me
====================

Getting Started
---------------

```
npm start
-> build game, open a browser, watch source and livereload browser on changes

npm run build
-> build game for gamejam submission (no sourcemap and livereload script)
```


Web Monetization
----------------
To enable Web Monetization, uncomment the call to `checkMonetization` in `onload`. This will add listeners to handle monetization events. At the appropriate time in your code, check `isMonetizationEnabled` to decide if extra features should be accessible or not. Remember to update the value of the `monetization` meta tag in `src/index.html` to your payment pointer.
