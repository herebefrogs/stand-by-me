inspiration
- oblivion how can a man die better than facing fearful odds? you don't have to die, everybody dies point it to die well
- star trek alien healing doctor mccoy by absorbing his wound on her
- making dying something meaningful (so you don't play the game the same way if you can die --- coil membership)

  - pointer: double click
  - gamepad
- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js

build chain
===========
- add CCapture.js for recording in-progress movies during development

custom:
- replace all const by var before JS gets inlined in HTML
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
libs:
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip?
  - Mac build https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool/releases/download/v0.8.3/ect-0.8.3-macOS.zip (need manual install & permission shenanigans)
  - npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ect-bin (but didn't seem to be available in command line afterwards... postinstall failed?)
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)


game engine port
- complete overall of viewport/camera/entity coordinate in map space and viewport canvas -> buffer canvas same as map
- moveX/Y -> velX/velY
